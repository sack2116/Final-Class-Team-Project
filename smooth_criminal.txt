"As he came into the window
 It was the sound of a crescendo
 He came into her apartment
 He left the bloodstains on the carpet
 She ran underneath the table
 He could see she was unable
 So she ran into the bedroom
 She was struck down
 It was her doom

 So, Annie, are you okay?
 Are you okay, Annie?
 Annie, are you okay?
 So, Annie, are you okay?
 Are you okay, Annie?
 Annie, are you okay?
 So, Annie, are you okay?
 Are you okay, Annie?
 Annie, are you okay?
 So, Annie, are you okay?
 Are you okay, Annie?

 That he struck you - a crescendo, Annie
 He came into your apartment
 He left the bloodstains on the carpet
