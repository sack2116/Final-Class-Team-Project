**Concept Overview**

Create a platform where users can:

1. Input or upload music or lyrics.
2. Classify the music into genres using a music classification model.
3. Generate new lyrics based on the detected or selected genre, style, and mood.

**System Workflow**

1. **Music Classification (Genre Detection)**:
    - Allow users to upload an audio file or provide existing lyrics.
    - Use the uploaded audio or lyrics to classify the genre of the music.
    - Provide an option for users to confirm or override the detected genre.
2. **Lyrics Generation**:
    - Once a genre is detected or selected, generate lyrics in that genre.
    - Users can customize additional parameters like style, language, rhyme scheme, and song title.
3. **Integration**:
    - Show a cohesive flow between classification and lyrics generation (e.g., detected genre automatically influences the lyric generation prompt).
    - Optionally, allow users to download the generated lyrics or upload them back for further classification.

**How to Present This**

**User Interface (Gradio App Example)**

The interface can include:

1. **Input Section**:
    - File upload (for audio) or text input (for lyrics).
    - Dropdown to manually select genre (optional).
2. **Music Classification Section**:
    - Display detected genre.
    - Provide options to confirm or change the genre.
3. **Lyrics Generation Section**:
    - Fields for title, style, rhyme scheme, and language.
    - Button to generate lyrics.
4. **Results Section**:
    - Display classified genre and generated lyrics side by side.

**Implementation Details**

**1\. Music Classification Module**

- Train or use a pre-trained music genre classification model.
  - For audio files: Use libraries like librosa to extract features (MFCCs, tempo, etc.) and train a classifier.
  - For lyrics: Use a text classification model like a fine-tuned transformer.

**2\. Lyrics Generation Module**

- Utilize the existing lyrics generation app.
- Enhance the prompt with the detected genre and style to generate context-specific lyrics.

**3\. Gradio Interface**

**Explanation for Presentation**

**1\. Demonstrate the Pipeline**

- Start by uploading an audio file or inputting lyrics.
- Show the detected genre and how it automatically populates the genre field for lyrics generation.
- Customize the song title, style, and rhyme scheme to generate personalized lyrics.

**2\. Use Case Scenarios**

- **Scenario 1**: A user uploads a rock song and generates new lyrics in the rock genre.
- **Scenario 2**: A user enters romantic lyrics, and the app classifies it as "Pop," suggesting a matching style for lyrics generation.

**3\. Highlight Integration**

- Explain how the system bridges two tasks—understanding existing music and creating new lyrics—offering a complete songwriting toolkit.

This approach creates a unified application and provides an engaging and practical way to demonstrate the synergy between classification and generation! Let me know if you’d like me to refine or expand on any specific part.
